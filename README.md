i’ve been breached ⁣
so I’ve put my shields up⁣
nowadays all reach⁣
i just wanna rap⁣
⁣
what I looked for in life’s ⁣
what I found in trap⁣
expression till I see bodies drop⁣
till I see bodies drop aye⁣
⁣
i ran with depression ⁣
suppressed learned a lesson ⁣
through dancing with devils ⁣
got honed into stun ⁣
making it precious experience⁣
deflected the truths were so hidden ⁣
i snapped this back on⁣
I’ve chosen to run into deals ⁣
i barely contorted to shapes ⁣
i wanted assigned to myself ⁣
so these were the lies that I ripped ⁣
to reveal the monster beneath⁣
⁣
in my skin so torn into shreds ⁣
I emerged a new being⁣
still human I bled⁣
still human I bled⁣
⁣
